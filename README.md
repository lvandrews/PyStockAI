# PyStockAI
Algorithmic stock price analysis and prediction.

This is merely a project to help me better learn python, not an actual useful utility.

## To do list (2022-11-04):
 * Add yahoo finance to retrieve_data.py
 * Build basic_analysis.py
   * grwe
   * hcfj



## Important notes
 * For those running a computer without CUDA architecture (requires CPU instead of GPU for ML processing), will need to compile tensorfow from source on your particular system
 * Models generated by CPU are known to be slightly inconsistent with those generated by GPU
