# PyStockAI
Algorithmic stock price analysis and prediction.

This is merely a project to help me better learn python, not an actual useful utility.

## To do list (2022-11-04):
 * Add yahoo finance to retrieve_data.py
 * Build basic_analysis.py
   * Copy latest data obtained by retrieve_data.py
   * Add moving averages (5, 10, 20, 50, 100)
   * Add relative strength index (RSI)
   * Other technical indicator?
   * Add buy/sell function, test function over time, calculate best success strategy
 * Build tensor_analysis.py
   * Copy latest data from basic_analysis.py
   * Train/run model using different strategies
   * Predict next 1-10 days with confidence interval
   * Add buy/sell function, test function over time, calculate best success strategy
 * Build hmm_analysis.py
   * Similar analysis as in tenstor_analysis.py
   * Use HMM approach
 * Update visualize.py
   * Visualizations for each of the above
   * Allow output to private website
   * Multiple plots per screen
   * Date of analysis, raw data used on screen
   * Useful calculated values on screen
   * Change name of script to something more useful

## Important notes
 * For those running a computer without CUDA architecture (requires CPU instead of GPU for ML processing), will need to compile tensorfow from source on your particular system
 * Models generated by CPU are known to be slightly inconsistent with those generated by GPU

## Installing
 1. Clone repo
 1. Install python3
 1. Install tensorflow and keras (see above about compiling for CPU)
 1. Install ta-lib dependencies in dependencies directory, follow instructions in that README
 1. Install python requirements with pip `pip install -r requirements`
 
## Obtain and analyze data
 1. Run retrieve_data.py to obtain data for one particular stock
 1. Run basic_model.py to build out technical indicators
 1. Run tensor_analysis.py to build out ML-based predictions
 1. Run hmm_analysis.py to build out HMM-based predictions
 1. Run visualize.py for graphical output and technical details
