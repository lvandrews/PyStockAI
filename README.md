# PyStockAI
Algorithmic stock price analysis and prediction.

This is merely a project to help me better learn python, not an actual useful utility.

Built in Linux Mint 20.1 within a VM on a mini PC with no CUDA cores.

## To do list (2022-11-04):
 * Add yahoo finance to retrieve_data.py -- ON HOLD --
 * Build basic_analysis.py
   * Copy latest data obtained by retrieve_data.py
   * Add moving averages (5, 10, 20, 50, 100)
   * Add relative strength index (RSI)
   * Other technical indicator?
   * Add buy/sell function, test function over time, calculate best success strategy
 * Build tensor_analysis.py
   * Copy latest data from basic_analysis.py
   * Train/run model using different strategies
   * Predict next 1-10 days with confidence interval
   * Add buy/sell function, test function over time, calculate best success strategy
 * Build hmm_analysis.py
   * Similar analysis as in tenstor_analysis.py
   * Use HMM approach
 * Update visualize.py
   * Visualizations for each of the above
   * Allow output to private website
   * Multiple plots per screen
   * Date of analysis, raw data used on screen
   * Useful calculated values on screen
   * Change name of script to something more useful
 * Build monitor_analysis.py
   * Maintains analyses on current list of stock symbols
   * Uploads latest data to private website
   * Can run from cron

## Important notes
 * For those running a computer without CUDA architecture (requires CPU instead of GPU for ML processing), will need to compile tensorfow from source on your particular system
 * Models generated by CPU are known to be slightly inconsistent with those generated by GPU
 * alpha_vantage
   * Stable API
   * Same data as yfinance
   * Many technical indicators can be queried directly
   * Can pay for min 75 requests per minute with no daily limits for $49.99/mo
   * Many useful data types behind paywall
     * Pay if your model justifies the cost
 * yfinance
   * No longer stable source of data
   * Minimum amount of useful data for building models

## Installing
 1. Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/lvandrews/PyStockAI.git`
 1. Install python3 (apt, yum, etc)
 1. Install tensorflow and keras (see above about compiling for CPU)
     * Need to add directions in dependencies directory
 1. Install ta-lib dependencies in dependencies directory, follow instructions in associated README files
 1. Install python requirements with pip `pip install -r requirements`
 
## Obtain and analyze data
 1. Run retrieve_data.py to obtain data for one particular stock
 1. Run basic_model.py to build out technical indicators
 1. Run tensor_analysis.py to build out ML-based predictions
 1. Run hmm_analysis.py to build out HMM-based predictions (script not yet built)
 1. Run visualize.py for graphical output and technical details
 1. Run monitor_analysis.py to update all symbols in analysis list (script not yet built)
     * Need to build list of symbols and maintenance scripts
 1. Observe output on private website (need to determine how to do this...)
